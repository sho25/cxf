Apache CXF 2.3.0 Release Notes

1. Overview

Apache CXF 2.3.0 is a significant new version of CXF that provides several 
new features and enhancements.  

New features include: 
 * JAX-WS 2.2 Support
 * JAX-RS 1.1 Support
 * New annotations for Java first use cases to reduce the need for 
   external configuration and provide more control over the runtime and
   generated WSDL:
     * @WSDLDocumentation annotation to add documentation nodes to generated
       wsdl
     * @SchemaValidation annotation to turn on schema validation
     * @DataBinding to set the databinding used (if other than JAXB)
     * @GZIP to turn on GZIP compression
     * @FastInfoset to turn on FastInfoset support
     * @Logging to turn on and control various Logging functionality
     * @EndpointProperty to configure endpoint properties
     * @Policy to associate WS-Policy documents with the service
 * SOAP/JMS spec implementation.  While CXF has supported SOAP over JMS 
   since 2.0, there wasn't a standard specification to describe how it 
   should be done so different vendors did things differently and 
   interoperability was impossible.  The new SOAP/JMS specification support
   implements the new SOAP/JMS spec to achieve a higher degree of 
   interoperability.  The older SOAP/JMS configuration is still supported.
   WS-Addressing also now fully works with the JMS transport when used in
   conjunction with the SOAP/JMS spec implementation.
 * SDO databinding
 * Schema Validation support for Aegis Databinding if Woodstox 4 is used 
   for the Stax parser

In addition to the above, CXF 2.3.0 was enhanced to reduce it's memory 
footprint and reduce it's startup time by delaying creation of many
objects until/unless they are really needed.

Users are encourage to review the migration guide at:
