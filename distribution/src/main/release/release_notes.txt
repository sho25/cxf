Apache CXF 2.6.0 Release Notes

1. Overview

The 2.6.0 version of Apache CXF is a significant new version of CXF 
that provides several new features and enhancements.  

New features include: 
* The big OSGi bundle used in the Karaf features.xml has been replaced 
  with the individual modules which are now all individual bundles. 
  The big OSGi bundle is still built, but some features may not be 
  available if that is used instead of the little bundles.
* New ability to configure HTTP Conduits from the OSGi config:admin service
* New ability to configure the CXF created HTTP Jetty ports from 
  config:admin service
* OAuth 2 support (new cxf-rt-rs-security-oauth2 module)
* The STS now supports the Renewal binding for SAML tokens.
* The STS also supports bulk issuing/validation/cancelling/renewal of 
  security tokens.
* The STS supports some advanced features based around Claims, such as 
  Claims Transformation, and pluggable custom Claims Parsing.
* The WS-Security module now supports replay detection by default of 
  Timestamps and UsernameToken nonces.
* New ability to register custom JAX-RS Context providers.
* New @UseAsyncMethod annotation for JAX-WS services.


Users are encourage to review the migration guide at:
http://cxf.apache.org/docs/26-migration-guide.html
for further information and requirements for upgrading to 2.6.x. In
particular, making the jars all OSGi bundles required moving some
packages around and marking many transitive dependencies as optional.
User applications may need to add additional dependencies into their
applications in order to upgrade.


2. Installation Prerequisites 

Before installing Apache CXF, make sure the following products,
with the specified versions, are installed on your system:

    * Java 5 Development Kit
    * Apache Maven 2.2.1 or 3.x to build the samples


3.  Integrating CXF Into You Application

If you use Maven to build your application, you need merely add
appropriate dependencies. See the pom.xml files in the samples.

If you don't use Maven, you'll need to add one or more jars to your
classpath. The file lib/WHICH_JARS should help you decide which 
jars you need.

4. Building the Samples

Building the samples included in the binary distribution is easy. Change to
the samples directory and follow the build instructions in the README.txt file 
included with each sample.

5. Reporting Problems

If you have any problems or want to send feedback of any kind, please e-mail the
