== Spring Boot - Samples - CXF Rest Web Services 

This sample project demonstrates how to use CXF JAX-RS services
with Spring Boot. This demo has two JAX-RS class resources being auto-discovered 
and deployed in a single JAX-RS endpoint. 

The application registers itself with Eureka Registry.  

The client discovers the client address from the registry and invokes it.

The sample uses Maven. It can be built and run from the command line.

To run the client from a command line:

1. If you have not started a eureka-registry application then build and start it 
first in the eureka-registry folder in a separate terminal window:

$ mvn spring-boot:run

2. Run the server 
----
$ mvn -Pserver
----

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello/ApacheCxfUser

will display "Hello ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello2/ApacheCxfUser

will display "Hello2 ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/swagger.json will return a Swagger JSON
description of services.


Before running a command line client check the application has been registered, open a browser 
and try "http://localhost:8761/eureka/apps". Once you see a registration record, 
open a new terminal window and run the client:

----
$ mvn -Pclient
----
