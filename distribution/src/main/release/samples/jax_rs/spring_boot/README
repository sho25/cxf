== Spring Boot - Samples - CXF Rest Web Services 

This sample project demonstrates how to use CXF JAX-RS services
with Spring Boot. This demo has two JAX-RS class resources being deployed in a single JAX-RS endpoint.  

The sample uses Maven. It can be built and run from the command line:

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello/ApacheCxfUser

will display "Hello ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello2/ApacheCxfUser

will display "Hello2 ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/swagger.json will return a Swagger JSON
description of services.

To run the client from a command line open a new terminal window and run:

----
$ mvn exec:java
----

Using Docker:
If you have Docker running on your machine (and appropriate DOCKER_HOST set), 
you can run

----
$ mvn docker:build
----

to create the Docker image.  Once created, you can start the container via:

----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -t org.apache.cxf.samples/spring-boot-sample-rs-cxf
----
