comment|/**  * A pipe between peers that channels transport-level messages.  *<p>  * A Conduit channels messages to a<b>single</b> destination, though  * this destination may fan-out to multiple receivers (for example a JMS topic).  *<p>  * A Conduit may have a back-channel, on which transport-level responses  * are received. Alternatively the back-channel destination may be decoupled,  * in which case the response it is received via a separate Conduit.  * The crucial distinction is whether the Conduit can itself correlate  * the response (which may be synchronous, or may be delivered via  * a dedicated destination).  *<p>  * Conduits may be used for multiple messages, either serially or  * concurrently, with the implementation taking care of mapping onto  * multiple transport resources (e.g. connections) if neccessary to  * support concurrency.  *<p>  * Binding-level MEPs may be realized over one or more Conduits.  */
