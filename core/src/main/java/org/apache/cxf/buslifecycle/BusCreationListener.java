comment|/**  * The listener interface for receiving notification of when<code>Bus</code>  * objects are created.  *  * It's a simplified form of BusLifeCycleListener that takes the  * target Bus as a parameter which is appropriate if the listener needs  * to be a singleton that works with multiple Bus objects.  *  * A common pattern would be to register a full BusLifeCycleListener on the  * target Bus to receive full Bus events  */
